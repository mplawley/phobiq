# phobiq
Allows the user to progressively unapply a Gaussian blur from an image through clicks and a slider. The code base also demonstrates unit-testable JavaScript using the Jasmine framework.

# Purpose
The client wanted to help patients with exposures to frightening images through progressive unblurring of the image. The client also wanted to learn more about unit testing with JavaScript. This project aims to address both sets of requirements.

# Future
* Allow the user to drag and drop their own images onto the page
* Allow the user to select URLs to images to embed onto the page
* Create a sign-in page
* Create a database for user data and preferred images
